# TDD mob programming workshop (2016-12-12)

In this workshop we'll learn about TDD and mob programming in a very hands-on and interactive way.

For each exercise, we'll start with a simple code Kata what we will implement using TDD.

We'll have one driver who will type the code in and everybody else will navigate him or her during the implementation.

Eventually, we'll try different formats, such as "ping pong" where we change a driver after each new test.

## Code Katas:

* [FizzBuzz](fizzbuzz.py)
* [Fibonacci](fibonacci.py)
* [Factorial](factorial.py)
* [Leap Year](leap_year.py)

### Longer/harder katas to consider:

* [Roman Numerals](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals)
* [Numbers in Words](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataNumbersInWords)
