## Background

> "Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated."

People will write a topic (or multiple topics) on an index card (example: "What's the best way to filter lists in python?"), then we'll dot-vote for all topics, prioritize and have a timeboxed discussion on each topic in order of priority. We'll do this for 1 hour and try to get through as many topics as we can and then will switch to a regular informal chat like we usually do. :)

If you want you can pre-submit the topics and/or vote on our [Meetup Trello board](https://trello.com/b/415wH9ll/beijing-monthly-python-meetup).
